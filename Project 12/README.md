# Project 12 - Showing we can do anything an array can

Create these functions in Racket that show that we can comfortably do the things in the List interface in Java (in all places, *x* is a list of numbers, *a* is a number, and *p* is an integer. Donâ€™t do any error checking. The order of these functions is random, so feel free to tackle them in any order):

(app a x) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return a list consisting of the numbers in x with the number a appended on the end  
(ins a p x) &nbsp;&nbsp; return a list that is x with a inserted in position p (position 0 is the beginning of the list)  
(get p x) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return the item from x that is in position p  
(set p a x) &nbsp;&nbsp; return the list consisting of x with the item in position p replaced by a  
(rem p x) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return the list consisting of x with the item in position p removed
