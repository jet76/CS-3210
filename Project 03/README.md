# Project 3

Implement VPL by starting from the given file Project3.java found in the VPL folder at the course web site (supported by the little class IntPair.java), which (along with some other useful stuff) does the irritating task of replacing symbolic labels by memory indices.

To begin, download Project3.java and IntPair.java to your working folder.

The given code assumes you are calling it from the command line. If you aren’t, you’ll need to change the code in obvious ways.

Put in code to implement all the operations. You should be able to use the code I have written that loads the VPL program into memory, replacing symbolic labels by actual indices.

Be sure to test your program thoroughly. I will run some additional, secret tests when you submit your work, but it is your responsibility to make sure that your project works on all the VPL programs given in the Tests folder, in addition to your programs from Project 1, and any other test programs that you think of.

As you’re working on this project, remember that this work will directly help you to prepare for Test 1, which will ask you to read, write, and execute VPL code, as well as to add new features to the VPL language. So, make sure that everyone in your group understands what is going on!

Be sure that the version you submit does no output other than what should be produced by VPL commands that do output. Also, be sure that 28 just prints an integer value and stays on the same line of output—don’t put in any extraneous output, like a newline.

When you are ready to submit your work email your file Project3.java as an attachment.

You must do this program in Java, purely for my and your convenience. If there is any feature of the program that you find difficult to do in Java, then you are probably doing something wrong! In other words, implementing a language this primitive should only require very primitive features of Java.
