# CS 3210 - Principles of Programming Languages

Description: This course traces the evolution of programming languages and identifies and analyzes the contributions made by several significant languages and their successors. Specific issues of programming language implementation such as creation of activation records for block structured languages and static and dynamic scoping as methods for defining program object visibility are studied in depth. All four of the modern programming language paradigms (procedural, functional, object-oriented, and logical) are studied.
